## Regex Components
A regex is a literal wrapped in slash characters (/). 
ex. /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/

### Anchors
We use the ^ anchor when we are trying to read the beginning of a string in a component. 
Additionally, we use the $ anchor when we are trying to read a string in which the $ signifies the end of the string, using the characters preceding.
